			<li>She clicks "premade balloons" and the page opens up into a new list with pictures and prices of each balloon.</li>
			<li>She finds the balloon she likes and clicks on "order now" listed underneath the photo which brings the site to a page saying she can pick up the balloon whenever she is ready with a field to put in the timeframe she should be able to pick up the balloon.</li>
