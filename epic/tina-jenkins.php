		<h4>Use case of Glenda Gottrocks</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Glenda is at work in the afternoon at about 16:00 when she realizes that she forgot to get her daughter a present for her birthday tomorrow so she pulls out her trust iPhone and opens safari to see what she can find.</li>

			<li>She sees that they have a website and clicks the link.</li>
			<li>There are a few options that the website pulls up for her like "premade balloons" and "custom orders"</li>
			<li>She clicks "premade balloons" and the page opens up into a new list with pictures and prices of each balloon.</li>
			<li>She finds the balloon she likes and clicks on "order now" listed underneath the photo which brings the site to a page saying she can pick up the balloon whenever she is ready with a field to put in the timeframe she should be able to pick up the balloon.</li>
			<li>The website sends my mom an email letting her know the type of balloon and what time she will be there to pick it up.</li>
			<li>After work she drives to pick up the balloon and pays with a check.</li>
			<li>The next day her daughter is excited to receive her present.</li>
